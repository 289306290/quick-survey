# 2.1.0

* Share with other managers as well as normal respondents.
* Clearer instructions on how to share, both as a grain manager and respondent.
* Show a check mark next to the save button when a save is done.

# 2.0.0

This is a version bump largely because compatibility with Heroku has been removed. Getting it to work on Heroku shouldn't be too hard, but I'm not going to guarantee it in the future.

* Enable CSV downloading.
* Updated sandstorm-meteor-admin package.
